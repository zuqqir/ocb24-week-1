<h2> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f1/cb/38/f1cb38fa7754a74b20886122caa5f734.jpg" alt="self love" width="500" height="180">
    <p> I am writing from the near future and i wanted to tell you if time travel was real, i do hope this letter reaches you safely.
    I wish to tell you that you have finally started accepting that everything in life can and will go wrong but you never gave up.
    Know that whatever that is troubling you now will pass and you accept yourself as who you are without holding back and here are the things you will need to know so you can love yourself further.</p> 
</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Faith</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Acceptance</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Choosing Yourself</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>
    <p>Once you have learn to do all this, you learn to love yourself without the validation of others and soon will discover these things:</p>
</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>That patience really is a virtue and you will be less angry in life</strong></li>
    <li><strong>That faith will be your trust in everything you do</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Once you learn to accept that things dont always go your way, you will worry less</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Putting your self worth and needs before others to please them</strong></li>

</ul>
